    <p>Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire, was born around 1258 in what is now modern-day Turkey. He was the leader of a small principality that grew to dominate much of the Middle East, Europe, and North Africa over the course of several centuries. His reign marked the beginning of an empire that would last for over 600 years. Osman’s leadership and military strategy were key to his success, and he is remembered for his role in uniting Turkish tribes and establishing a strong administrative system. His vision of an empire based on military prowess, trade, and culture laid the foundation for one of the most powerful empires in history.</p>
